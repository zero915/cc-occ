Certainly! Below is a minimal implementation of an Apache module in PHP that intercepts every POST request, analyzes it, and if it contains the letter "Z," replies with "The letter 'Z' was found!" Additionally, it blocks further processing by other handlers. This implementation is designed to work across different PHP setups and is Dockerized for easy testing.

Go to the root directory (where the ZInterceptor.php file is located)

Now, let's create a Dockerized environment for testing. Create a `Dockerfile`:

```Dockerfile
FROM php:7.4-apache

# Enable Apache module
RUN a2enmod ZInterceptor

# Copy the PHP script to the web directory
COPY ZInterceptor.php /var/www/html/ZInterceptor.php
```

Build the Docker image:

```bash
docker build -t z-interceptor .
```

Run the Docker container:

```bash
docker run -p 8080:80 z-interceptor
```

Now, you can send POST requests to `http://localhost:8080/ZInterceptor.php`, and if the letter 'Z' is present, you should get the response "The letter 'Z' was found!"

Ensure to adapt this code and the Dockerfile based on your specific needs and PHP setup. Additionally, consider enhancing security measures, such as input validation and sanitization, depending on the requirements of your application.
